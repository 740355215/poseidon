Poseidon is Firmament's (http://camsas.org/firmament) integration with
Kubernetes.

## System requirements

## Getting started

## Contributing

We always welcome contributions to Poseidon. One contribution you can
easily make as a newcomer is to do **code reviews** -- this also helps you
familiarise yourself with the Firmament code base, _en passant_.

We use GerritHub for our code reviews. You can find the Poseidon review board
there:

https://review.gerrithub.io/#/q/project:ms705/poseidon+is:open

In order to do code reviews, you will need an account on GerritHub (you can link
your GitHub account).

If you would like to contribute a **pull request**, that's also most welcome!
The easiest way to submit changes for review is to check out Poseidon from
GerritHub, or to add GerritHub as a remote. Alternatively, you can submit a pull
request on GitHub and we will import it for review on GerritHub.
